# advent of code

i decided to throw all of my advent of code into one giant monolithic repository

information for each languages i've done are in `utilities`, in the readme file

source is in `src` and resources are in `resources`

## how to run?

there is a very useful run.py in the root dir

run it like this:
```
python3 run.py pascal2023day1part1
```
and it will find the answer to day 1 part 1 2023 written in pascal

you can shorten day and part to just d and p

thanks and have fun.
